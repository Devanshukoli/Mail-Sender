# Mail-Sender

It's project using django that helps to send a meail without using existing mail portal like google , yahoo, etc.

Also If you find something to tech me then please notify me...

NOTE: here in this project you have to create a virtual environment to run the project so don't forget about that....

I have noticed that this project can be modifed in some different way from viewing some youtube videos and oniine google docs and stuff. 
but I am stil confused as to how should i start with ? 

If anyone got any idea or something feel free to comment on this. I will not be able to respond immediately but defeinlty try my best ...Thanks.
